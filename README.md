# 110-Practice-Test

Write a program that is given two floats for comparison and a third float that is a difference threshold, called epsilon. Output one of three phrases:

* output "equal" if the floats are within 0.001 (exclusively) of each other

* output "close enough" if the floats are within epsilon (exclusively) of each other

* output "not close" if floats are not within epsilon

Ex: If the input is:

    14.1
    14.2
    0.2

the output is:

    close enough

Ex: If the input is:

    2.1125
    2.1132
    0.02

the output is:

    equal

Ex: If the input is:

    5.1
    5.0
    0.05

the output is:

    not close
